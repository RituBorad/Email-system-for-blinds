### Voice-Based-Email-For-The-Blind

- Email is an essential part of modern life, but for the blind and visually impaired community, receiving emails can be very difficult. If you are blind or visually impaired, Speaking Email might be perfect for you. The app reads out the contents of your inbox one email at a time, moving on to the next automatically. It skips over email signatures, disclaimers and other email-specific clutter making for a smooth and seamless reading experience.

- All the codes are developed in python along with Django 2.1 framework.

- Google APIs for Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech conversion are used.

- For reference about each module, please refer the flowcharts.
